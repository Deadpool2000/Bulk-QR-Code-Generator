## Why I made this?
### Oh, you know, I got fed up with those QR code swindlers trying to rob us blind, so I thought, 'Why not join the racket?' But being the generous soul I am, I decided to flip the script and offer my own tool for free. ðŸ˜Ž


###  I whipped up this little QR code gem as a 'timepass' activity. Because clearly, what else is there to do at work besides revolutionize the digital world one pixel at a time, right? ðŸ™ƒ
